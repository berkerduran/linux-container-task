Overview
This project sets up a basic Python HTTP server that listens on port 8000. The server is containerized using Docker, allowing it to run in any environment that supports Docker.

Features:
Python HTTP server that serves simple HTTP requests.
Docker support for containerization, making it easy to deploy and manage.
Requirements
Docker (installed and running)
Basic knowledge of Python and Docker
Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to get the server running in Docker:

Docker Deployment
Clone the repository (or download the project files).
Navigate to the project directory where your Dockerfile and app.py are located.
Build the Docker image by running the following command:
bash
Copy code
docker build -t python-http-server .
Run the Docker container using the following command:
bash
Copy code
docker run -p 8000:8000 python-http-server
This will start the HTTP server and expose it on port 8000.
Usage
Once the Docker container is running, you can access the Python HTTP server by navigating to:

arduino
Copy code
http://localhost:8000
The server will display a directory listing of its contents. You can modify the app.py file or add other files as needed.

Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues with port binding (e.g., if port 8000 is already in use), try stopping other services using that port or change the port mapping in the docker run command:
bash
Copy code
docker run -p 8080:8000 python-http-server
This will map the container's port 8000 to your host's port 8080.
